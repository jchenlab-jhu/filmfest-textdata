it was just the black shoe and then the screen went black
The boy got hit by a car whilst he was showing off and trying to impress the girl.\nthe car that hit him hits another car and is launched in to the air.\nThe girl looks horrified and the boys shoe flys through the air and land in the gutter near her.  There are also other shoes in the gutter.
The shoe with no known owner just lay in the road.
The car fell on the ground from the accident. The covered her face in fear. Then you could see a shoe falling and landing next to the sidewalk next to another shoe.
A red car flew into the air. The woman in the red jumper looked in horror as the mans shoe flew high in the sky and landed in the road nearby her. 
"After the accident the camera pans to a shoe lying on the side of the road, The camera then rolls forward a bit to reveal another different type shoe laying at the side of road."
THE MAN WHO WAS DRINKING THE MILK FROM THE CARTON WAS PLAYING WITH THE YOUNG WOMEN AND NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO THE ROAD A CAR COMES AND RUNS HIM DOWN HIS SHOE SHOT UP IN THE AIR AND LANDED ON THE FLOOR
The car finishes flipping over upside down. One of the mans shoes flies through the air and lands on the floor next to another shoe that just happens to be there.
"The car from the crash flies through the air, before the camera shows the lady looking shocked and distressed. After this, a single show can be seen flying through the air from the car and landing on the side of the road. After landing, the camera follows along the kerb of the road to show another single shoe also laying there."
"The girl looked on at the accident all horrified, as the guy's shoe flew in the air and landed in the gutter.  The camera scrolled over to show another old shoe further up the street, I guess showing us that this happens all the time."
"The man on one side of the street and the woman on the other continue walking but mimicking each other, whatever the woman does the man copies and vice versa. She starts doing silly walks and putting her hand on her head etc and he does the same. Then she gets to a corner and stops and waves her hands as if to tell him to stop walking as there is a car coming but he believes she is still playing their game so he continues into the road waving his hands, gets hit by a car and then his shoe comes off, flies through the air and lands on the side of the pavement next to another shoe."
"We see the mans shoe that flew off in the accident and then a little bit away, another shoe."
"The car that struck the milk-drinking man ramps over another car and flies through the air before landing roughly and bursting into flames. The woman watches in horror as one of the man's shoes flies through the air towards her. The camera then pans to another, different shoe lying in the gutter."
after they showed the shoe on the ground nearby was another shoe .
"The smarmy looking man was hit by a car because he was not paying attention to where he was walking. Instead, he was fixated on the girl across the street who had been miming his every move. After the collision, the car flew into the air and we can only assume the smarmy looking man was gravely damaged as well. The last we image we saw was the shoe of the dumb looking guy detached from his body, laying solemnly on the road."
OH MY GOODNESS YOU MISSED SO MUCH.  THE GUY AND THE GIRL ARE WATCHING EACH OTHER AND EVERYTHING THE GUY DOES THE GIRL THEN IMMITATES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET. SADLY IN PLAYING THIS GAME THE GUY FAILS TO NOTICE AN ONCOMING VEHICLE WHICH RUNS INTO HIM AND THEN THE VEHICLE FLIES UP INTO THE AIR AND CRASH LANDS.  THE GUYS SHOE (THE GUY WHO HAD BEEN RUN OVER) FLEW INTO THE AIR AND LANDS ON THE ROAD SIDE AND SO WE ARE BACK TO THE START OF THE VIDEO CLIP WHICH SHOWED A SHOE (EVEN BEFORE WE SAW THE GUY DRINKING MILK FROM A CARTON) AND THE WORDS SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF LETS SEE HOW THE SHOE ENDED UP HERE.
"We just saw another shoe, in the gutter, which was black, next to milk guy's trainer."
an accident happened to theman drinking the milk and he die but his shoe flew up and landed on the floor
The main characters shoe was on the ground after he was hit by that car and then the camera moved to another shoe that was also on the ground.
After the crash the girl watches the show fly through the air to land in the gutter. Just a few inches further along is another shoe in the same situation.
"A car crashes on the ground from the air. Shortly after the crash, a sneaker/trainer is seen flying through the air, shortly before landing in a gutter. The camera pans along, to show another shoe also in the gutter."
The explosion sent his shoe flying into the air! The woman was in shock
"The main characters shoe lands on the ground, next to a shoe that looks like it has been there a while leaving you to think, did something similar happen to the person this shoe belonged to?"
"We see the landing on the ground having previously been flipped in the air. The woman who was mimicking the man's movements down the street looks worried and looks up into the air and sees a shoe flying through the air. It lands on the ground next to the curb and it is one of the man's trainers. The camera, at ground level, then pans up the road slightly and we come across another shoe, a black leather-looking boot/hightop, but we dont know to whom it belongs yet"
The shoe the man was wearing fell out of the sky and landed in the gutter. Another different shoe was laying in the gutter a few feet away.
The shoe from man hit by the car went flying through the air and landed on the ground. We see the shoe on the ground. The camera then pans a little further down the road and we see another shoe.
"After the accident, the camera pans to the main characters footwear in a similar way to the very beginning of the movie. The footwear is pictured lying next to a sidewalk. The camera then pans to another piece of footwear lying nearby which is a different piece of footwear to the earlier footwear.  "
"The camera is fixed on the shoe of the young man who just (presumably) died in the crash. But then ... the camera pans across a few feet to reveal another, different shoe. The implication being that similar accidents have happened in the past - possibly because of the actions of the young girl?"
After the crash we see the man's shoe on the ground and then we see another shoe.
When the shoe lands the camera pans up the road a bit and shows a different shoe in the same position.
The man drinking the milk is shooed away from an old man's car. The man trips then put the milk carton on top of a fence. The women in the skirt trips. The man and woman begin mimicking each other's actions until the distracted man is hit by a car. The woman in the skirt looks on in shock. One of the man's shoes flies off his foot and hits the sidewalk and lands near a black boot.
After the accident the show flew off the guy's foot and landed near the sidewalk while the girl watched. Then the camre panned up to another black shoe. 
Just a picture of the shoe at the end
"The car flips, eventually coming to a stop. The woman looks up, absolutely horrified. Flying through the air is the man's shoe. It goes under the overhead wires, eventually landing in the road right next to the kerb. It is then revealed that another shoe can be seen to the left of this man's shoe, also in the road next to the kerb."
a guy was following what a girl was doing and was not paying attention and walked off the curb and got hit by a car
"The camera focuses on a different random shoe that is in the road, suggesting this type of accident has happened before."
The shoe worn by the man who had been drinking milk earlier flies somersaults through the air and lands in the gutter. The camera pans past it to another suggesting the woman who had been distracting the man might have caused another similar incident before
"The car struck the man and lifted him into the air, the car struck an obstacle which lifted it too. His trainers lay scattered beside the pavement."
"After the guy was hit by that car, the camera panned to his shoe that came off his foot. As it the camera panned it showed a shoe the girl wore, who he was playing 'Simon says' with before he got hit by the car."
It was just a continued shot of the second shoe that landed in the gutter. 
"After the accident, a shoe seen falling from above, close to where it landed happens to be another shoe."
He didn't miss much. The camera zoomed into a black shoe lying on the road next to the kerb.
so the man that was walking out told him to get off his car so he walked off but he was still looking at the girl so he started walking the same way the girl was so he started soing like little stuff and she was mocking him and remeber the carton he had he sat it on someone fence and she acted like she was doing the same so while they were walking down the sidewalk they were like playing and mocking each other then she stopped and made a reaction because a car was coming he thought she was playing but it was really a car but they never was making any noise girl the car hit him and busted the windshield he flew in the air the car rolled and flew in the air the girl was just looking and next thing you know the shoe that we saw him tapping earlier landed by the girl but it was weird cause it was another shoe there as well 
The shoe fell on the pavement and another shoe was on the side 
The music from the dance resumes and we pan across the ground from the shoes the guy was wearing to a new shoe... indicating a new performance may begin
It was just a zoomed in picture of the shoe the man was wearing.
"Main character saw a women who started to copy what he does. After a while of simulation of coping, main character ran into a car not knowing what's happening to him. He gets hit and a shoe appears out of nowhere coming to the women."
nothing happened. the camera focused on the second shoe and then the movie ended.
"They didn't miss much. The camera showed the guy's shoe land in the gutter, then a couple of seconds later it pans along to show his other shoe, which looks battered."
All there is a shoe laying in gutter
"shoe knocked off guy hit bar car in gutter, shot then pans to a different shoe in the gutter "
after getting hit by the car there is a close up of the damage where you can also see his shoe on the pavement 
After meeting with a very bad car accident the trainer shoe of that man is lying on the road on its kerb. Just ahead of that there is another black leather boot lying near the kerb of road.
"The man shoe that was flying through the air is now lying by the kerb. The camera pans slowly up and reveals another different shoe lying there. Who is it, we don't know"
"The camera pans along the kerb from where the shoe has fallen, to another broken looking shoe which i assume had been left there from a similar incident before"
"The car falls from the air, then fell down. The man's shoe is seen gliding across the air through an electric pole until it falls next to a pavement. The camera pans slowly across the pavement until his second shoe comes into view. "
The camera pans along two shoes resting against the kerb.
We see the shoe lying on the side of the road. The camera moves forward and we see another discarded shoe.
The shoe is shown lying at the side of the road.
The mans shoe has flown off and landed in the kerb where the camera pans along to show another different shoe also has ended up in the kerb.
the car crashes and the shoe from the begging of the movie falls next top someone elses other shoe
"As a result of having been hit by the car while being distracted, the shoes are now on the street. The shoes have fallen off of their user, and are all alone."
Nothing.  The clip of the black shoe was the end of the film. 
The training shoe of the young man has landed next to the kerb in the street. There is a black boot close by which has been thrown away by someone.
"The car that hit the man with the sneakers throws the man high in the air. The sneakers, one by one, appear on the screen on the ground alone without the man."
"As the car crashes, the man's shoe is flung into the air. The woman watches horrified with her hands over her mouth. The shoe lands in the gutter of the road, and the camera pans along to reveal another, different shoe there."
"Turns out the car the guy was leaning on wasn't his as another guy guy shoes him away from the car.  So the first guy drinking the milk walks on down the street and sees the pretty girl on the other side of the street, He notices her mimic his every action as he finish the milk and puts the carton on a fence post.  The pretty girl on the other side of the street mimics his action and several others as the guy continues down the street.  But the guy sees the girl mimic his actions so he does some more  and he watches the girl mimic him.  But when he gets to the street intersection, the guy is caught up in the  girls actions and get hit by a car and is thrown into the air.  And all that remains is the worn sneaker as it falls to the ground."
"After the main character was hit by the car that was the end , you didnt miss anything"
"We see the aftermath of the car crash. The woman looks in horror as the man is hit. He was hit so hard, his shoe went flying in the air and landed by a curb. The camera panned over from the character's shoe to an old shoe also near the curb."
"The shoe of the man hit by the car falls to the pavement, mimicking the same shot as the beginning of the film, the shot then pans to reveal another shoe in the same place, presumably this has happened before."
The camera continues to pan past the second black shoe beside the kerb.
there was another shoe at the side of the road as if the same thing had happened before. 
The close up of the new black shoe continues and then the screen goes to black. 
You see the guys shoe hit the ground and they stay on it for awhile and then the camera zooms forward and you see another random black shoe just sitting there. 
The car lands the right way up though very damaged. A shoe flies across the sky and lands at the side of the road.
"The shoe of the man flies through the air and lands next to a curb, where there is another shoe. "
"The car that hit the man goes flying and ends up crashing on its side. Then, the tennis shoe the man was wearing also goes flying and ends up on the side of the road. You then see another shoe on the side of the road nearby. "
"The movie shows the shoe, that came from the man who was hit by the car. This shoe is shown laying on the street like how it was shown at the beginning of the movie."
there was a black shoe laying next to the sidewalk.
The car smashes into the road with an explosion. The woman is then seen gasping in shock. A single show (from the mans foot) goes flying into the air and lands at the side of the road. The camera then pans along slowly to reveal another shoe not too far from where his fell.
