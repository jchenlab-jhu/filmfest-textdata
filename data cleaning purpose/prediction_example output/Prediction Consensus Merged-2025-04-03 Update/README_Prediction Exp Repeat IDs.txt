Prediction Consensus List of Repeats

A few participants who took part of the Prediction Consensus experiments experienced their session randomly looping back and repeating the instructions and experiment. This note documents the debug/session IDs (IDs used to track participants in the raw psiturk data files) of all participants who experienced this issue and which participants were dropped from the cleaned dataset. 

**********************************************************************************************Other notes: 
- Unfortunately, this issue seemed to be a product of server migration from Mechanical Turk to psiturk, rather than a issue in the experiment code itself.

- Though the timepoint in the experiments at which the session looped seems to differ, all participants who experienced looping had their session repeat from the very beginning of the session, starting from the instructions and moving through the experiment again. Some participants even experienced looping multiple times.

**********************************************************************************************
Participants whom experienced looping in the middle of the experiment phase, hence later repeating the experiment phase, were dropped from the cleaned dataset since their initial incomplete exposure to the experiment phase may bias their responses in the 2nd experiment phase after the experiment looped to the beginning.

**********************************************************************************************
Participants whom experienced looping in the practice phase or instruction phase (section below) were not dropped from the cleaned dataset. Since these participant had not yet reached the experiment phase before looping, the looping is inferred to have minimal impact on participant responses in the experiment phase.
