The rock will sleep
Alien life will come about and use the rock for something
He goes back to sleep, and the cycle begins again.
Cycle repeats itself forever
The mountain will have another dream.
He finally gets his long awaited peace
The mountain will finally sleep!!
The cycle continues he sleeps dinosaurs come and it just repeats the entire series of events.
The cycle will start over again.
The cycle will start all over again.
The cycle will start over the same as it didn't at the very beginning.
The rock will cry at the thought of his past.
The rock now sleeping, will repeat the cycle again.
The cycle will repeat itself and the rock will become glass again.
I think the rock will start dreaming again about other things that might happen to him.
The rock will have the same fate as the last one.
I think that the rock will die.
I'm guessing they're hinting that the same process is going to happen on a different planet.
The movie will show the ending credits.
I think the cycle will start all over again, with the weather eroding the rock down till it is smaller, and then going through all of the life changes all over again.
The rock will sleep peacefully as a mountaintop for many years.
all will start once again
I think its all going to start over again. "The big bang theory." I think it was all a dream.
He will begin the life cycle of a rock again, from the beginning, at a different planet this time.
the process of evolution will once again occur!
The cycle will start again with the rock waking up
the rock will see the humans come to his new planet and the process will repeat
Another scene showing the passage of time will occur.
The rock will be disrupted from its rest again
it will all start again
A alien spaceship will find the rock.
The mountain will start to erode again.
