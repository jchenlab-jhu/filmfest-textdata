The main character shoe that fell off his foot after being hit by the car is zoomed in on and focused on the shoe. 
it was just the black shoe and then the screen went black
The shoe with no known owner just lay in the road.
THE MAN WHO WAS DRINKING THE MILK FROM THE CARTON WAS PLAYING WITH THE YOUNG WOMEN AND NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO THE ROAD A CAR COMES AND RUNS HIM DOWN HIS SHOE SHOT UP IN THE AIR AND LANDED ON THE FLOOR
The man on one side of the street and the woman on the other continue walking but mimicking each other, whatever the woman does the man copies and vice versa. She starts doing silly walks and putting her hand on her head etc and he does the same. Then she gets to a corner and stops and waves her hands as if to tell him to stop walking as there is a car coming but he believes she is still playing their game so he continues into the road waving his hands, gets hit by a car and then his shoe comes off, flies through the air and lands on the side of the pavement next to another shoe.
OH MY GOODNESS YOU MISSED SO MUCH.  THE GUY AND THE GIRL ARE WATCHING EACH OTHER AND EVERYTHING THE GUY DOES THE GIRL THEN IMMITATES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET. SADLY IN PLAYING THIS GAME THE GUY FAILS TO NOTICE AN ONCOMING VEHICLE WHICH RUNS INTO HIM AND THEN THE VEHICLE FLIES UP INTO THE AIR AND CRASH LANDS.  THE GUYS SHOE (THE GUY WHO HAD BEEN RUN OVER) FLEW INTO THE AIR AND LANDS ON THE ROAD SIDE AND SO WE ARE BACK TO THE START OF THE VIDEO CLIP WHICH SHOWED A SHOE (EVEN BEFORE WE SAW THE GUY DRINKING MILK FROM A CARTON) AND THE WORDS SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF LETS SEE HOW THE SHOE ENDED UP HERE.
We just saw another shoe, in the gutter, which was black, next to milk guy's trainer.
Just a picture of the shoe at the end
The camera focuses on a different random shoe that is in the road, suggesting this type of accident has happened before.
It was just a continued shot of the second shoe that landed in the gutter. 
He didn't miss much. The camera zoomed into a black shoe lying on the road next to the kerb.
It was just a zoomed in picture of the shoe the man was wearing.
nothing happened. the camera focused on the second shoe and then the movie ended.
They didn't miss much. The camera showed the guy's shoe land in the gutter, then a couple of seconds later it pans along to show his other shoe, which looks battered.
All there is a shoe laying in gutter
The shoe is shown lying at the side of the road.
As a result of having been hit by the car while being distracted, the shoes are now on the street. The shoes have fallen off of their user, and are all alone.
Nothing.  The clip of the black shoe was the end of the film. 
After the main character was hit by the car that was the end , you didnt miss anything
The camera continues to pan past the second black shoe beside the kerb.
there was another shoe at the side of the road as if the same thing had happened before. 
The close up of the new black shoe continues and then the screen goes to black. 
The movie shows the shoe, that came from the man who was hit by the car. This shoe is shown laying on the street like how it was shown at the beginning of the movie.
there was a black shoe laying next to the sidewalk.
all that was left was the man's shoe. 
I'm not sure if this was an error but it was a less than a second clip of the shoe in the road, nothing else happened
there was a shoe lying on the ground. nothing else happened
All you have missed is the camera zooming in on his shoe lying in the gutter. 
A different shoe is located on the ground next to the original shoe. 
it just zoomed into the shoe at the end
