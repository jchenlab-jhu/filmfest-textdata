I put some files into experiment specific folders as some file names are the same as each other across experiments. Here I will explain where each file in the experiment specific folders belong in the original Description Consensus folders.

	The clean and raw folders belong in "Descriptions" in whichever experiment they 	correlate to. I would probably create a new folder for them within that folder called 	"2024- Full Run 2" in which to upload these.

	Similarly, eventdata.csv, questiondata.csv, and trialdata.csv belong in "Raw Psiturk 	Data Files", and I would make a similar subfolder to denote that they are from after Run 	2.

***NOTE: These datafiles and descriptions contain data from both Run 1 AND Run 2 so do not separately combine them with the original Run (1) files***

Also, another note, the raw folder now contains the demographics info of all retained participants.
