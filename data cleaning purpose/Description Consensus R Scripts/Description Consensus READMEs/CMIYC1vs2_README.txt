CMIYC (long) 1 vs 2

In total, CMIYC should have have 9 counterbalances, just like the other movies. Unfortunately, because CMIYC is so long, the platform we were hosting the experiments on could not fit the entire size of CMIYC with all the counterbalances. Thus, CMIYC was split into the following:

CMIYC_1 = counterbalances A-F (based off the video folder names)
- these are similar to counterbalances 0-5 of other experiments

CMIYC_2 = counterbalances G-I (based off the video folder names)
- these are similar to counterbalances 6-8 of other experiments
