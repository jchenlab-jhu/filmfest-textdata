"2028","subj_trailer_text","I would say I mostly avoid trailers. I do this because I just don't want to know what is going to happen. If I see a trailer and I see that the main character is going to be locked in a room, the whole movie up until that point I am busy in my head trying to figure out what is going to cause that character to get in the room and the room get locked. So I am more preoccupied with that than just being able to watch things unfold. I usually don't read book synopsis either, by the way. I just love the discovery as I go along, movie or book.","3","debugrOZi7:debugwCBdQ","subjective_experience","busstop"
"2029","subj_spoiler_addtltext","I think trailers give away way too much. But then again, I rarely watch them so I can't say if that is true or not.

I remember when I was young and the Empire Strikes Back had just come out. I hadn't been able to go see it yet, and I was avoiding everything I could to not know what was going to happen (this was easy, pre-internet and I was like 13 yrs old). So anyway, I was walking by my brother's bedroom and his friend was in there telling him about the movie because he had just seen it. And right when I walk by he says ""and Darth Vader is Luke's father"" and at first I was like ""what I didn't see that coming"" then I was so mad at him for saying that, but he didn't even know I was in the hall, and I was so mad at myself for being there. So maybe that's why I don't like spoilers even now. ","3","debugrOZi7:debugwCBdQ","subjective_experience","busstop"
