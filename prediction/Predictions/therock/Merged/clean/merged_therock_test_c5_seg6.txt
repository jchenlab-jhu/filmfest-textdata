I think the "rock" will be blasted into space vie explosive decompression.
The rock will see many things in space.
The rock will fall from space back to earth.
I think the rock will explore outer space.
The rocket will crash on the moon and the rock will get stuck there.
The rock while still embedded into the rocket will go around the moon and other planets as it observes the solar system.
The rock will end up on the moon.
The rock falls back down.
he is going to land on the moon
The rock is finally able to sleep.
The rock will take pictures of the solar system.
I think it might get some sleep now that it's in space where nothing will really bother it
The now glass lens rock travels through space and comes in contact with aliens.
some stone in the space is going to crash the spaceship
The satellite will blow up.
I think the rock will float around space for eternity.
The man will push the button and release the satellite into orbit where the stone, which is now a glass, will finally be able to rest.
I think what will happen next is the rock will be ejected into space.
I think the rock/glass will hit an asteroid.
The rock sees an alien
The capsule lands on some celestial object -- maybe the moon? -- and is now a space rock.
He will be part of the famous spaceship.
I think after the spaceship will land "the rock" ( glass ) will have ll the time in the world to finally sleep.
the rock will be happy to be in space
The rock will explode.
The satellite will break and the rock will be left tumbling through space
The rock will finally find itself in a quiet place where it can rest and observe the earth
It will see bigger rocks in space.
the glass that the rock has become is jettisoned and falls back to earth.
Wow, ok. I think the stone will let a lazer shine through it and destroy a meteorite.
the satellite with be used to transmit a signal then be left ito float in space
the satellite is going to take pictures of the moon
