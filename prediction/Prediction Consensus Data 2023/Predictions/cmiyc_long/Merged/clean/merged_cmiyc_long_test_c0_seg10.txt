The movie shows Christmas morning and some elaborate present his parent's gave to Frank JR
She will walk up and hug him and tell him she wasn't leaving without him either.
We will see that Frank get's his charm and con-artistry from his father
The main character will dance with his wife.
The movie will show how Frank's father influenced him to become a conman.
they dance and tell more of a story
the dad has more dialogue with his son
The father will walk over and start dancing with the mother.
Walking will kiss his wife
Frank senior will then lock eyes with his wife & they will kiss.
I think Frank's parents will dance together and he will watch.
The dad will go start dancing with her.
The family will continue talking and having their little party.
They open some Christmas gifts.
I think Frank Sr. will go over to his wife and dance with her while their son watches.
The father will keep talking and join his wife in dancing.
They will continue talking to eachother.
They will hug.
It will cut to a time in the future where Frank's mom has died.
They are going to continue their conversation.
I believe Frank and his father will argue.
I think the husband will dance with his wife.
Frank dances.
His father continues to talk about his mother, and then the next scene starts
They will open Christmas presents.
He is gonna tell his wife he loves her.
Frank still continues on how mesmerized he was when he saw his wife till he has her to marry him
Frank Senior continues telling his story and Frank Junior keeps finishing his lines and story.
The older man will share some secret or something he wanted to say for a while with his family.
I think that there will be an explosion in which both of Frank Jnr.'s parents die.
Frank senior and his wife start to dance closely and Frank junior is embarrassed and leaves the room.
